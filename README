Control much of the functionality of a Chumby device via any web browser.

Utilizes the built in web server, perl, bash and various code that comes stock with the Chumby.

1) Using ssh or scp place all files in /psp/cgi-bin/

2) Once installed you can start your journey of control by pointing a web browser at 
http://ip-of-the-chumby/cgi-bin/custom/index.cgi

An easy method to install this that will not require use of shelling into the Chumby will be available soon. 

Currently tested and confirmed to work on a Chumby Insignia 3.5

NB. The current version should be considered Alpha grade. It works....but not elegantly. Hooks are in place that are not
yet tied into the web interface. Stay calm and eat a jaffa.
