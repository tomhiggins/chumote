Control much of the functionality of a Chumby device via any web browser.

Utilizes the built in web server, perl, bash and various code that comes stock with the Chumby.
Update 6/29/12 A new version will work with Zurk's setup soon.

1) Using ssh or scp place all files in /psp/cgi-bin/

2) Once installed you can start your journey of control by pointing a web browser at 
http://ip-of-the-chumby/cgi-bin/custom/index.cgi

An easy method to install this that will not require use of shelling into the Chumby will be available soon. 

Currently tested and confirmed to work on a Chumby Insignia 3.5

NB. The current version should be considered Alpha grade. It works....but not elegantly. Hooks are in place that are not
yet tied into the web interface. Stay calm and eat a jaffa.

Update 6/5/12 Had to stop working on this project due to life, I aim to get back on things in a few weeks...by which time 
I should be able to have the code work with Zurk's lattest firmware replacement. 

History of the project......
A few hours after I got my first chumby last week I realized it was more a linux box than a consumer toy. Given how
I wanted to use the devices I started looking into what it would take to control it remotely. Finding a web server,
perl and bash already onboard I started working on a web front end to some of the features I would be using regularly.
Looking about the web and chumby wiki for help I then found Chumbymote (http://wecreategames.com/blog/?p=181). They had 
already worked out the screen capture stuff, the general layout and some of the functionality. I took it, cleaned up the
code some and started adding/reworking things. Much thanks to their efforts as it got the dev rolling nicely. After a 
two days of working up the podcatching/streaming, fm tuning and stream reporting a friend suggested I make a github repo
of the project. Here it is and here it will continue to be worked on. Enjoy.
